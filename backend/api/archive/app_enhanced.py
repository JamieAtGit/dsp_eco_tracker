# ENHANCED IMPORT UPDATE FOR YOUR FLASK APP
# =========================================

# OPTION 1: Quick One-Line Change (Recommended)
# Just replace lines 21-27 with:

from backend.scrapers.amazon.integrated_scraper import (
    scrape_amazon_product_page,
    estimate_origin_country,
    resolve_brand_origin,
    save_brand_locations,
    haversine,
    origin_hubs,
    uk_hub
)

# That's it! The integrated_scraper provides all the same functions
# with enhanced accuracy and graceful fallback.

# =========================================

# OPTION 2: Keep Your Current Imports (Safest)
# If you want to test first without changing your app.py,
# just add this after your current imports:

# Keep your existing imports as they are:
from backend.scrapers.amazon.scrape_amazon_titles import (
    scrape_amazon_product_page as original_scraper,
    estimate_origin_country,
    resolve_brand_origin,
    save_brand_locations,
    haversine,
    origin_hubs,
    uk_hub
)

# Add the enhanced scraper with a different name:
from backend.scrapers.amazon.integrated_scraper import scrape_amazon_product_page as enhanced_scraper

# Then in your code, you can choose which one to use:
# product = enhanced_scraper(url)  # Use enhanced version
# product = original_scraper(url)  # Use original version

# =========================================

# COMPLETE EXAMPLE - YOUR UPDATED IMPORTS:

"""
Replace lines 20-27 in your app.py with this:
"""

import pandas as pd

# Enhanced scraper with all the same functions
from backend.scrapers.amazon.integrated_scraper import (
    scrape_amazon_product_page,
    estimate_origin_country,
    resolve_brand_origin,
    save_brand_locations,
    haversine,
    origin_hubs,
    uk_hub
)

# Note: The integrated_scraper exports all the same functions
# so your code doesn't need any other changes!
